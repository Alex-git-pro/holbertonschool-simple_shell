.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "January 2025" "Version 1.0" "Simple Shell Manual"

.SH NAME
simple_shell - A lightweight Unix command interpreter.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
[\fIinput_file\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a basic command interpreter that executes user commands either interactively or from a specified file. It implements a subset of the functionality of standard Unix shells.
.PP
The shell processes commands by checking if they are built-ins. If not, it searches for the executable in directories specified by the PATH environment variable. When located, the command is executed in a new process.

.SS Interactive Mode
When launched without arguments and connected to a terminal, the shell operates interactively, displaying the prompt:
.B $
and waiting for user input.

.SS Non-Interactive Mode
When provided with an input file or when standard input is redirected, the shell processes commands sequentially without displaying a prompt.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following commands are natively supported:

.TP
.B exit [\fIstatus\fR]
Terminates the shell, returning \fIstatus\fR. Defaults to 0 if no \fIstatus\fR is provided.

.TP
.B env
Displays all environment variables.

.TP
.B Copy the file  to 
Copies a file from \fI\fR to \fI\fR.

.TP
.B   ...  times
Executes a command multiple times as specified by \fInumber\fR.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Certain environment variables affect the shell's behavior:

.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories to search for executable files. If unset or empty, only the current directory is searched.

.TP
.B HOME
The default location for user-specific files, typically used by external commands.

.SH RETURN CODES
The shell exits with one of the following codes:
.TP
.B 0
Command executed successfully.
.TP
.B 127
Command not found in PATH.
.TP
.B 1-255
Error encountered during execution or exit code of the last command.

.SH EXAMPLES
Interactive usage:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ ./simple_shell
$ echo "Hello, world!"
Hello, world!
$ env
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin
HOME=/home/user
$ Copy the file input.txt to output.txt
$ exit 0
.RE
.fi

.PP
Non-interactive usage:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ echo "ls" | ./simple_shell
file1 file2 file3
$ ./simple_shell commands.txt
.RE
.fi
